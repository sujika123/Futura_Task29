1. What is the difference in the place value of 5 in the numeral 754853?
A.	49500
B.	49950
C.	45000
D.	49940

Answer : B

    The first 5 is in the ten-thousands place: 5×10,000=50,0005×10,000=50,000
    The second 5 is in the tens place: 5×10=505×10=50

Next, we find the difference between these place values:
50,000−50=49,95050,000−50=49,950

2.What is the compound interest on Rs. 2500 for 2 years at rate of interest 4% per annum?
A.	Rs. 180
B.	Rs. 204
C.	Rs. 210
D.	Rs. 220

Answer : B

To calculate the compound interest, we use the formula:

A = P(1 + r/100)**n

where:

    PP is the principal amount (Rs. 2500)
    rr is the rate of interest per annum (4%)
    nn is the number of years (2)

First, we calculate the amount A :

A = 2500(1 + 4/100)**2
A = 2500(1+0.04)**2
A = 2500(1.04)**2
A = 2500×1.0816
A = 2704

The compound interest CICI is the amount AA minus the principal PP:

CI = A−PCI=A−P
CI = 2704−2500
CI = 204C
I=204

Therefore, the compound interest on Rs. 2500 for 2 years at a rate of interest of 4% per annum is:

3.A: B: C is in the ratio of 3: 2: 5. How much money will C get out of Rs 1260?
A.	252
B.	125
C.	503
D.	None of these


Answer: D


Given the ratio A: B: C is 3: 2: 5, we need to find out how much money C will get out of Rs 1260.

First, we calculate the total number of parts in the ratio:
3+2+5=103+2+5=10

Now, we determine the amount C gets, which is 5 parts out of the total 10 parts:

C’s share = (5/10)×1260
C’s share = 0.5×1260
C’s share = 630

Therefore, C will get: 630

4.Which one of the following is not a prime number?
A.31
B.61
C.71
D.91


Answer : D

91 :
        Factors: 1, 7, 13, and 91
        91 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 7 and 13.

Therefore, the number that is not a prime number is : 91

5.A running man crosses a bridge of length 500 meters in 4 minutes. At what speed he is running?
A.	8.5 km/s
B.	7.5 km/s
C.	9.5 km/s
D.	6.5 km/s

Answer : B

To find the speed at which the man is running, we need to use the formula for speed:

Speed = Distance/Time

The man crosses a bridge of length 500 meters in 4 minutes.

First, we need to convert the time into seconds to find the speed in meters per second (m/s):

4 minutes=4×60 seconds=240 seconds4 minutes=4×60 seconds=240 seconds

Now, we calculate the speed in meters per second (m/s):

Speed = 500 meters/240 seconds
     = 25/12 m/s
     ≈ 2.08 m/s

Next, we convert the speed into kilometers per hour (km/h). Since 1 m/s is equal to 3.6 km/h:

Speed in km/h = 2.08 × 3.6
              ≈ 7.5 km/h

Therefore, the man's running speed is : 7.5 km/h
